title: Résumé
# subtitle: My research focuses on developing high-order finite element schemes for efficient non-hydrostatic ocean modeling. I develop C++ and Python code to carry out large-scale simulations of ocean dynamics on high-performance architecture frameworks. I am currently looking for Summer 2025 internship opportunities.

## **RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**

Development of an Adaptive Locally-Nonhydrostatic Ocean Model<span style="float: right; ">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span>  
Graduate Research Project | Guide: Prof. Pierre Lermusiaux<span style="float: right; ">Sep 2021 - Ongoing</span>

Designed a novel ocean model that locally resolves complex dynamics and achieves computational savings compared to traditional globally-non-hydrostatic models. Currently incorporating this model into a C++ hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin solver and devising numerical techniques to overcome computational limitations and conduct large-scale regional ocean simulations.

Extension and Analysis of Rarefied Gas Dynamics Solver<span style="float: right; ">RWTH Aachen University</span>  
Bachelor Thesis | Guide: Prof. Manuel Torrilhon<span style="float: right; ">May 2020 - Jan 2021</span>

Studied the stability of a FEniCS-based Discontinuous Galerkin FEM solver that solves the linearized regularized 13 (R13) moment equations to study non-equilibrium gas dynamics problems. Extended solver to accommodate non-linear conservation equations.

Numerical Investigation of the Flapping Dynamics of Multi-Layered Plates<span style="float: right; ">Birla Institute of Technology and Science</span>  
Undergraduate Research Project | Guide: Prof. Pardha S. Gurugubelli <span style="float: right; ">Feb 2020 - May 2021</span>

Employed a MATLAB-based finite element method code to study fluid-structure interaction dynamics of multi-layered plates flap- ping in a uniform flow. Enhanced solver to allow coupling between high-order fluid elements and low-order structural elements.

Detached Eddy Simulations of Flow Past Structures at High Reynolds Numbers<span style="float: right; ">Birla Institute of Technology and Science</span>  
Undergraduate Research Project | Guide: Prof. Sabareesh G. Rajasekharan<span style="float: right; ">Aug 2019 - Jan 2021</span>

Optimized building design for the LIGO India observatory to minimize wind load and vibrations through corner modification and windbreaks. Executed 3D Detached Eddy Simulations on ANSYS FLUENT to capture turbulence at high Reynolds number regimes.

## **INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE** 

Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Flow in Induction Pumps<span style="float: right; ">Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research</span>  
Research Intern (Thermal Hydraulics Division) | Guide: Dr. Kumaresan Natesan<span style="float: right; ">May 2019 - Jul 2019</span>

Simulated MHD flows by coupling Navier-Stokes and Maxwell’s equations in COMSOL. Validated the method with Hunt’s bench- mark laminar solution and conducted preliminary simulations for Annular Linear Induction Pumps used in fast breeder reactors.
