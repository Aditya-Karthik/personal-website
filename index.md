<div id="describe-text">
	<p>I am a PhD candidate at MIT specializing in scientific computing and mechanical engineering, with a minor in machine learning. My research focuses on developing cutting-edge numerical techniques to enhance the efficiency of non-hydrostatic ocean models, with applications in large-scale regional simulations to study complex ocean dynamics. I am proficient in C++ and Python, with a solid foundation in numerical linear algebra, fluid mechanics, and stochastic processes. I am seeking opportunities to apply my skills in industry-driven projects that leverage high-performance computing and advanced simulation tools.</p>
