Optimized building design for the LIGO India observatory to minimize wind load and vibrations by incorporating edge modifications and windbreaks. Turbulent flow past the building was simulated using the 3D Detatched Eddy Simulation (DES) framework in ANSYS Fluent, leveraging LES for near-field and RANS far-field. The CFD results were validated against wind tunnel experiments on a scaled model with good correlation in pressure coefficients and vibration response.
