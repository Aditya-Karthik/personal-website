The regularized 13 moment (R13) equations are a macroscopic model for the description of rarefied gas flows in the transition regime. Extended a finite element solver for the R13 equations FenicsR13 to accommodated non-linear conservation equations. Compared solutions with that produced by commerical software ANSYS and COMSOL for the case of non-isothermal lid-driven cavity flow. Investigated the solver's CIP stabilization scheme to deduce optimal stabilization parameters.
