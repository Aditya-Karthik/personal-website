Piezoelectric patches mounted on flexible plates exhibiting flapping motion are used to generate energy. These patches are typically multilayered but studies have been primarily restricted to the flapping dynamics of single-layered plates. Employed a MATLAB-based finite element method code to study fluid structure interaction dynamics of realistic multi-layered plates flapping in a uniform flow. Numerical investigations new revealed response regimes due to the anisotropy within the plate. Enhanced solver to allow coupling between high-order fluid elements and low-order structural elements to improve computational efficiency.
