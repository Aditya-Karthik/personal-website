Designed a novel ocean model that locally resolves complex dynamics and achieves computational savings compared to traditional globally-non-hydrostatic models. Currently incorporating this model into a C++ hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin solver and devising numerical techniques to overcome computational limitations and conduct large-scale regional ocean simulations.
