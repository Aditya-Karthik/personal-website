Preconditioning linear systems arising from numerical discretization of PDEs is a crucial for robust simulations. Developed a reinforcement learning framework in Python using the Advantage Actor Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization models to generate preconditioners for finite element discretized elliptic PDEs. <i>ON GOING PROJECT</i>
