Electromagnetic pumps used to cool fast reactors work by moving liquid metal using electromagnetic induction. I worked towards magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of liquid sodium flow through annular linear induction pumps (ALIP). Validated COMOSOL-based MHD simulations of laminar flow of conducting liquid in a rectangular duct under a uniform magnetic field against benchmark solutions (Hunt et al. 1965 JFM). Conducted preliminary simulations of liquid sodium flow through an ALIP using the MHD framework.
